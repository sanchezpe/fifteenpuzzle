# Web Programming Step by Step 
## Assignment: Fifteen Puzzle
### Description
This assignment is about JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling.

The "Fifteen puzzle" (more generally called the Sliding Puzzle) is a simple classic game consisting of a 4x4 grid of numbered squares with one square missing. The object of the game is to arrange the tiles into numerical order by repeatedly sliding a square that neighbors the missing square into its empty space.

You will write the JavaScript code for a page **fifteen.html** that plays the Fifteen Puzzle. You will also submit a background image of your own choosing, displayed underneath the tiles of the board. Choose any image you like, so long as its tiles can be distinguished on the board. Turn in the following files:

* **fifteen.js**, the JavaScript code for your web page
* **background.jpg**, your background image, suitable for a puzzle of size 400x400px

You will not submit any .html or .css file, nor directly write any XHTML or CSS code in this assignment. Instead, we will provide you with the XHTML and CSS code to use, which should not be modified. (You should download these files to your machine while you're writing your JavaScript code, but your code should work with the provided files unmodified.) To modify the page's behavior and content, write JavaScript code that interacts with the page using the DOM. To modify its appearance, write appropriate DOM code to change styles of onscreen elements by setting classes, IDs, and/or style properties on them.
